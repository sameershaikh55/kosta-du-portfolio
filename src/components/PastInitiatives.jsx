					A Dubai HQed business aimed to access the African market. They decided
					to employ ATH54’s team to run local activities. Our launchpad in Accra
					was the best choice. The solution was fully rebranded including a name
					adoption to the local consumers. Market intelligence, business model
					development, competitors analysis, hiring the team all of these
					crucial points were covered by my team. Today the project experiences
					growth. The team counts a few local employees, grow the customer base,
					generate revenue. Recently new products were added to address local
					needs. The company is looking to go to Nigeria later on.

					The business required me to perform a market intelligence and touch
					the water for their new frontier – Africa. Under the umbrella of my
					initiative ATH54 the presence of the Chatex was established in Accra,
					Ghana. Where we had office space and Human Resources. During the
					project, my team prepared a clear market research, hired local
					representatives, arranged initial meetings with local financial
					companies to partner with. At that stage the project got independence
					and left our hub.

					“African Trading Hub 54” was a joint venture between myself and Safir,
					a Ukraine based consultancy firm. The primary purpose of launching the
					initiative was finding businesses interested in establishing
					activities in African countries to sell or to purchase products there.
					We successfully settled three companies in Ghana in 2018. The three
					firms required more attention and all venture’s activities were
					shifted to support actual customers. The goal was achieved. The
					project met success and being paused.

					Selling cryptocurrencies mining equipment required a particular
					vehicle back in 2019. The project was an arm of the Forbidden Forest
					idea. The mining supercomputers were manufactured by third-party
					suppliers, a few factories in China. Worldwide based customers
					required a proper company to purchase equipment from. My job was to
					help establish a legal entity in Switzerland. We chose this location
					because of its attitude to crypto-assets and safety. As well, I named
					the project and managed to develop a whole branding and positioning of
					the cohort of Chinese suppliers into a single trading body.

					Crypto-focused investment boutique helped more than 50 startups secure

					preparing and launching events, investor negotiations, consulting
					startups, attending industry events and speaking on behalf of the
					company. When a few recognisable points achieved, I became a Managing
					Director in the UK. I successfully onboard customers and generated

					Initial Coin Offering the project had been performing is the primary
					purpose to call me for help. I grasped my fundraising experience with
					my previous projects. That’s why owners of the project asked my
					advice. VISO issued own tokens on Waves blockchain for rapid payments.
					My join to the project brought full rebranding, vision clearance,
					go-to-market strategy amendment. From the opaque poor expressed
					project, the idea became bright and clear. My involvement helped to
					secure US$4.2mln investments.

					Enormous deep technological expertise is a key differentiator of
					Invention Bridge. Exceptional researchers and developers are sometimes
					lacking in presenting well their achievements. At the end of 2017, the
					company encouraged me to represent their invention on the global
					scene. My job included branding the product from scratch, creating a
					story around it, getting in touch with influencers, collecting
					pre-orders and being a leader. The public met the idea and supported
					it very well. Even I managed to secure a few selling agreements before
					the product was ready.

					It was my very first time when I personally tried the role of being a
					CTO at a startup. It was a really cool experience indeed. Even without
					coding experience, I was able to manage software developers and invent
					the whole solution. Infeedex an animal feed formulation platform
					belongs to an Irish company called Aine NutriScience. My job was to
					transform the deep team’s knowledge in the industry of feeding dairy
					cows into a useful scalable online platform. I managed to add a
					technology that explores and analyse field grass by drones with
					near-infrared cameras to precise information to the system. It was a
					significant value-added to optimise the rations better.

					It was the most complicated project I ever had to work with. The
					company has a variety of sophisticated security technologies. Good
					examples will be multi-spectral computer vision based on thermal,
					visual, machine vision and radar technologies. The latest invention is
					a sphere radar protects against drone attacks. The management asked me
					to develop an International Growth Plan. The main goal was to reach
					the Middle East market and find the right set of customers there.
					After my plan, the company improved its international ambitions and
					became well represented across the Middle East.

					The longest business I had so far. I built the whole thing alone. Took
					six years of my life since its invention back in 2011. It made me take
					an MBA course. Secure almost a million-dollar investment and establish
					the presence of it across the globe. I am proud of it. The start-up
					created footfall counting systems for brick-and-mortar retail sites.
					We won customers like Mitsubishi, Swarovski, LeroyMerlin, Harley
					Davidson, Specialized Bikes etc. Equipped over 3,200 retails locations
					around the globe. Unfortunately, lost the business because we were
					immature at the day when our investors pushed us to conquer the US
					market with not enough budget.
